        <h2>The start of bioshocks Development</h2>
	<p>The Development of Bioshock took place over the course of seven years it all started with a man name Ken Levin and irrational games which later became 2k games the first thing they knew was what the core game would look like a drone that would collect resources a protector that would guard the drone and a harvester that would try to take that resource those three things would eventually become the little sister the big daddy's and the splicers. Bioshock went though many changes from being in space to having the game have a more rpg feel it was even gonna be set in a WW2 german lab but they made all the right choices when coming to the final game they were influnced to make a free form type shooter that put player control high up and the desire to break gaming trends and cliche's Bioshock was made under a strong foundation while it had a good start but the two sequels and two DLC that came out after the orginal game never really matched or outdid what 2k made on their first go. Bioshock doesnt hold your hand for long the charaters in the game tell you what to do but not always how to do it the game respects the players intelligence Bioshock is a sand box the game gives you tools and make you show them what you can do with the tools each person that plays Bioshock will make differnt choices in what to use in the game which adds endless replays for the game you might think oh this clyclone trap looks crap but in your next playthough you just might experment theres a bunch of way to kill the splices its recess and Rapture is your playground and everything is viable to use Bioshock makes the perfect mixture of balance an fun Bioshock is a rare video game that justifys every aspect of gameplay. The weapons in Bioshock feel and sound awsome each gun has three types of ammo theres even a crfating system however the game isnt perfect the aiming on console can feel stiff you can aim down sights but its slugish also the weapon changing can feel bad but those are only on console and the camera while a neat idead to take photos of enemys to learn their weakness at first its quite fun to take photos but after a while you just spam the photos.</p>

   <h2>Enemy desgin and AI</h2> 
    <ul>
    <p>Enemy placement is somthing thats not really talked about when it comes to game development in Bioshock splicers and big daddys are always gonna show up there is a few scripted incounters like when you first find the shotgun you will always be mugged but a group of splicers vauleable items will be place infront of the player to grab but when you do enemys will spawn but it teaches you to always be careful and to know whats going on around you in after clearing an area if you return ther will be a chance that splicers or big daddy's will be there unlike other games Bioshock is unpredictable there is only really one area where the spawing feels cheap and thats the beehive in the farmers market the shooting is not always the fun its how the combat is set up the game doesnt count on jumpscares the fear is psychological the lighting and the sound desgin makes Bioshock also scary as you wander though Rapture you can hear splices walking around and it puts you on edge when the big daddy's also move your screen shakes at the core Bioshock is an fps games at its best it also has elements of horror rpg and adventure which the other games dont have Bioshock is as important to the fps genre as Doom, Half life and Halo combat evolved but nothing really came out of Bioshock the cliches are still being used in games to this day.</p>

    <h2>Level desgin and art</h2>
    <p>One of the reasons Bioshock is a master piece is due to the level desgin Bioshock took influance from Resident Evil 4 2k games liked how open the levels were how the player could ingage enemys and loot explore and find items the inventory and ammo managment so its no shock that Bioshock used the same open level desgin for their game dont you hate it when in a game you see a door but you cant go though it while they have reasons for not allowing people to go that way like invisble walls some of the best games are victim to this Bioshock makes these barrers belivable Ken Levin said in an interview that he knew that he wanted to make a game that was in an area that was remote and complete because when ever he plays games in these natural enviorments he would see a jersey barrier but he wouldnt be able to jump over them which he hated because he would rather simalute somthing completely so the player would never have that press on the suspension of disbelief to where the player is asking wait why cant I jump over this barrier he would rather make a world where the player can do anything they can expect to do at the end of the day the gaem comes down to player choice you could hack turrents so thay watch your back hack vending mechines but you run the risk of failing them which could result it lose of health alarms going off its a risk reward type of thing in the search for supplies the player will have to use their brains and think the levels of Bioshock are also very interactable sure you could shoot everyone but in some points you can see oil on the floor and what can you do with oil all the areas of Rapture are different in feel and theme the lighthosue is the bridge to Rapture Fort Frolic is the neon show bis area where people go to unwind and have fun olympus hights is the upperclass area with fancy suites apollo square has a new york streets vibe to it where the working class live each area is a puzzle piece that shows how Rapture comes together it gives reason why people would come down here when you look at the art yeah it may not look good as modern day games but it still is very nice to look at and the style of Rapture is art deco which appeared in the early 1900's Raptures style is very good with the biopunk theme with glass ceilings walls and tubes allowing players to see Rapture from every angle there are blue ligths showing the horrors in Rapture you can also see the poor upkeep in Rapture with broken tubes spilling water destroyed doors if the game had no story it would still be a master piece based off art and level desgin alone.</p>
