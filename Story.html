   <h2>ACT 1 history of rapture</h2> 
    <ul>
    <bp>Rapture was a utopia made by Andrew Ryan to escape the polictal social and religious aspects in a post world war 2 world. He had an idea where the goverment didnt control the economics it was about freedom Ryan viwed morality as a blockade to sucess so Rapture was a place that valued science logic and reason above that was consided right and wrong at the start a lot of people went to rapture it became a bustling city full of the brightest people in the world but things went wrong. With no funding taxes nothing could be gained without paying a price the less fortunate was given no aid by Rapture and its people and they started to not be very pleased with Andrew Ryan and start to not think of Rapture as a utopia they called home without any ethical standeds in place busniess where able to act however they wanted they then found a thing called adam from a special kind of sea slug that could rewrite the genetic code of a person without limits but adam was highly addictive it was fierced requiring more adam to stop the insanity. chaos then broke out as the need for adam sky rocketed mobster Frank fontaine saw this as an opening to start a criminal empire and turn the lower class against Andrew Ryan in the crave for adam drastic times called drastic mesure so the little sisters program was founded the little sisters were use in ganetic experments to make adam but in reality what they would do was a little girl would go up to a body with a needle and and sitck it into the body and take the left over adam out so it can be recycled and the big daddys were made to protect the little sisters but that couldnt fix the issues with rapture so a massive civil war broke out between Andrew and Fontaine.</bp>

			   <h2>The twist and ending</h2>
<bp> When you make it into Ryans office he doesnt put up a fight he just stands behind glass playing golf he then gives a speach about what makes a man and a slave he then as Jack is about to enter the room where Ryan is he stops Jack by saying would you kindly Jack stops after that line he then gives other orders to Jack that end in would you kindly Jack then remembers all the times that Atlas would say would you kindly it is then revealed that Jack would obey any command so long as it ends o starts with would you kindly after killing Ryan Jack takes a key and puts it into a device Atlas then reveals himself as actually being Frank Fontaine it is then revaled that Jack is actually a baby that was ment to age fast and return to raputure and Frank Fontaine plans to run rapture Fontaine is about to spirng his trap but the little sisters save Jack he then wakes up in Dr Tenenbum's hideout where she has undone some of the brainwashing on Jack but Fontaine has got other plans he then starts code yellow it then turns into a race against time where you have to find the cure in Fontaines office Jack then heads to Fontaines location to kill Fontaine where you see that he has put two much adam into him turning him into a beast but if you look at him he kinda looks like the Atlas statue after a long battle Jack finally drains him of Adam and all that remains is the choices that the player made if the player drained the little sisters Jack becomes evil and teams up with the splicers to take control of nukes but if you didnt drain any little sisters you get the good ending which shows Jack getting out of rapture with the little sisters and taking care of them until His death.</bp>
